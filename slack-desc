scons: SCons (A software construction tool)
scons:
scons: SCons is a software construction tool -- that is, a superior
scons: alternative to the classic "Make" build tool that we all know and
scons: love.
scons: SCons is implemented as a Python script and set of modules, and
scons: SCons "configuration files" are actually executed as Python scripts.
scons: This gives SCons many powerful capabilities not found in other
scons: software build tools.
